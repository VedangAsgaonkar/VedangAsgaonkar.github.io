For the most part this site is made from an academic POV, but here are some of my other likings.

## Music ðŸŽ§
I generally like soulful and lofi songs, typically with a good amount of musical instruments. The occassional metal song is also welcome. Some of my favorites are Waqt Ki Batein by Dream Note and Vienna by Billy Joel.

## TV shows and movies ðŸŽ¦
I prefer to watch light TV shows, generally sitcoms. My taste in movies is a total contrast, I like movies with a strong story line, typically with some amount of drama and a twist. 

## Sports âš¾
I enjoy working out, swimming and playing ping-pong. I generally prefer sports that are played solo or in small teams.
