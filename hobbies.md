Here is what I would like the world to believe I do in my free time (which may or may not exist, open the box to figure out 🐱📦).

## Music 🎧
I generally like soulful and lofi songs, typically with a good amount of guitar and piano. My playlists would only partially agree.

## TV shows and movies 🎦
I prefer to watch light TV shows, generally sitcoms. My taste in movies is a total contrast, I like movies with a strong story line, typically with some amount of drama and a twist. 

## Sports ⚾
I enjoy working out, swimming and playing ping-pong. I generally prefer sports that are played solo or in small teams.
