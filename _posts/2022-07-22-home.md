You have landed on the website of Vedang Asgaonkar, a third year undergraduate at the [Department of Computer Science and Engineering](https://cse.iitb.ac.in) at IIT Bombay. I take interest in computer systems and machine learning, particularly the mathematical side of it. I am always up for some elegant puzzles or problems.

I have done some interesting projects in ML, networks and software development. I have also been involved in data science research in collaboration with IIMA and Stanford. My most recent internship involved working on evolutionary game theory at IST Austria. Currently pursuing research in theoretical machine learning with Prof. Abir De at IITB.

I am interested in logical insights on human and social behaviour, and read books and blogs about the same. Models of social interaction, opinion dynamics and competition pique my curiosity. I plan to post some blogs about the same in my free time.

I have also worked as teaching assistant for linear algebra at the dept. of math at IITB. I have also been a TA on the [NPTEL](https://nptel.ac.in/) platform for the course "An Introduction to Programming through C++". I may post resources for courses in the future. Some such resources can be found in my [github](https://github.com/VedangAsgaonkar) repositories.
