You have landed on the website of Vedang Asgaonkar, a senior undergraduate student at the [Department of Computer Science and Engineering](https://cse.iitb.ac.in) 💻 at IIT Bombay 🇮🇳. I take interest in computer systems and machine learning, particularly the mathematical side of it. I am always up for some elegant puzzles or problems 🧠. Contrary to popular belief, I do have a life. I enjoy hanging out with close friends, and am always up for new experiences. Travel is the love of my life (and food, the way to my heart), and I am a bit more adventurous than my insurance provider would like. You might find me in the gym or playing ping-pong if you drop by at a random time.

## Work

I have done some interesting projects in ML, networks and software development. My most recent internship was in low latency systems at Optiver Amsterdam 🇳🇱. I've done my fair share of research at IITB, in active feature acquisition under Prof. Abir De, and in time series retrieval under Prof. Sunita Sarawagi. I have also been involved in data science research in collaboration with IIMA and Stanford. I've also worked on evolutionary game theory at IST Austria 🇦🇹. 

## Curiosities

I am interested in logical insights on human and social behaviour, and read books and blogs about the same. Models of social interaction, opinion dynamics and competition pique my curiosity. I plan to post some blogs 💬 about the same in my free time (has not happened as of Fall'23). I enjoy writing convoluted sentences that take an entire [NVIDIA A100](https://www.nvidia.com/en-in/data-center/a100/) GPU to understand.

## Teaching

Currently TAing for the undergraduate course in Artifical Intelligence and Machine learning, I have also conducted recitals for the minor course on Design and Analysis of Algorithms. I have also been a TA on the [NPTEL](https://nptel.ac.in/) platform for the course "An Introduction to Programming through C++". I may post resources for courses in the future. Some such resources can be found in my [github](https://github.com/VedangAsgaonkar) repositories. I have also worked as teaching assistant for linear algebra at the dept. of math at IITB.

## Contact me
Come and meet me in person at H17 IIT Bombay. Make sure to bring a protein bar 🍫 or a pizza 🍕 . Alternatively find me on LinkedIn, Instagram or Facebook 🔗. You can also drop a mail to [first name][at]cse[dot]iitb[dot]ac[dot]in
